    "# Exposure to drought\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the SPI drought index as an indicator of exposure to drought risk. Similar to indicators 1.1 and 1.2, this indicator is not a direct measure of health impacts of drought, but rather a measure of the risk factor, which is mediated by a range of complicated causes to health. In general, the claim is that increase in this indicator represents an increased risk, which may lead directly to negative impacts on health or require adaptation measures to mitigate negative impacts.\n",

    "## TODO literature on selection of drought index (over how many months do we take SPI?)\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2009, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) approved the Lincoln Declaration on Drought Indices (LDDI). The LDDI recommends that \"the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) be used to characterize the meteorological droughts around the world\", in addition to other drought indices that were in use in their service. In support of this recommendation, it was suggested that a \"comprehensive user manual\" describing the SPI should be developed. The manual provides a description of the index, the computation methods, specific examples of where it is currently being used, the strengths and limitations and mapping capabilities.\n",
