# Indicators Exposure to climate change

The repository contains the code to calculate a range of climate-data based indicators with relevance to human health

## Running the code

The easiest way to set up Python to run this code is to use `conda` - either the minimal [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)
installation or the full [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution.
The libraries and packages needed can be installed into a `conda` environment using the dependencies described in the
`environment.yml` file - see the documentation [here](https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html).

You will need to run the Jupter notebook service to work with the `.ipynb` notebook files.

The key working can be found in the relevant notebooks:

[Temperature change exposure ERA](https://github.com/mangecoeur/health-climate-exposure/blob/master/Temperature%20change%20exposure%20ERA.ipynb)

[Heatwave exposure change](https://github.com/mangecoeur/health-climate-exposure/blob/master/Heatwave%20exposure%20change.ipynb)

[Labour capacity change](https://github.com/mangecoeur/health-climate-exposure/blob/master/Labour%20capacity%20change.ipynb)


## Input data download

A (fairly large) amound of input data is needed.
